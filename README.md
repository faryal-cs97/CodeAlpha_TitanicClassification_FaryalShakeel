Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more. The Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912, killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived.

In this article, we will analyze the Titanic data set and make two predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction to see if we wouldâ€™ve survived.

This repository contains a project aimed at classifying passengers on the Titanic and predicting their survival based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and other relevant attributes. The goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster.
